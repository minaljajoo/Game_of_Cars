# Game of Cars
The Game of Cars is a fun, interactive way to become more familiar with machine learning. Inspired by the Game of Life, users draw from the card deck to begin the game. Users are then able to make subsequent decisions based on selections granted by their chosen cards. Meanwhile, machine learning  models are called each time a user makes a decision and determines which selections each users should be allotted next. Throughout the game, users can click on ‘model’ cards to read the technical configuration of each machine learning model. Machine learning models used in the Game of Cards include SciLearn Decision Tree, KMeans, K Nearest Neighbor, and Tensor Flow. Pick a card, start the game, and learn more about machine learning
